Welcome to the Speer Backend Assessment!

## Instructions

1. When you see the login page, there is only one account on there.

Username: client1
Password: client1

2. The first thing you'll see is a title with the client's first name and last name. Clicking on it will take you to the client's profile page. Over there, you'll see how many stocks the client owns and their portfolio value.

3. Below the profile name, there is an 'Add Balance' feature where you can add any amount of balance to your wallet. There is no limit here! Once you add in balance, it'll also make an update to the respective client's record in the database, meaning the next time you log in, you'll see a new added balance.

### Buy/Sell Stocks

4. The first box you'll see is the buy stock box. Enter in a symbol. If the symbol exists, the app will pull the respective quote from the symbol and iwill display it on the quotes section at the very bottom of the page. It'll also update the price value with the current stock price. Once that's set you can't change it unless you delete the symbol.

5. The second box is the sell stock box. It works exactly like how it's described for the buy stock feature, except it'll be used to sell stocks instead.

6. Last but not least, the logout button. Click on this button to fully logout from your account and be redirected back to the login page.
